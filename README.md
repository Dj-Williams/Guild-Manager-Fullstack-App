I am proud to present my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/cQ3daSLf/wdi-project-3) for this for this project/app, and I feel like I was struck by a lightning bolt of inspiration and created a plan from that moment which I followed through the various problems on the way to completing a viable MVP. 

My Stretch Goals are highlighted in gold and I'm proud for finally completing one!
