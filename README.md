# Guild-Manager-Fullstack-App
Ready the Provisions! Sharpen your blade! Ready Your Spells! CHARGE FORTH TOWARD ADVENTURE!

The idea behind this app was inspired by the long nights of anguish spent writing the perfect character to embark on a new adveture with your friends, only to lose it to time. This Guild manager app serves as a resource for tabletop role-players to manage their various characters and campaigns.

I am proud to present my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/cQ3daSLf/wdi-project-3) for this for this project/app, and I feel like I was struck by a lightning bolt of inspiration and created a plan from that moment which I followed through the various problems on the way to completing a viable MVP. 

My Stretch Goals are highlighted in gold and I'm proud for finally completing one!
